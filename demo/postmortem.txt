Rights:

    We communicated a lot on slack, which definitely helped with splitting up
    work and making sure that no work was duplicated. We also instituted a
    required review process on github, which ensured that everyone had a
    pretty good understanding of the codebase, as well as enforcing that all
    merged code had unit tests.

    We were very collaborative and iterative in the game design process. As
    we play-tested, we all kept an open mind to new ideas, and freely made
    changes to the structure of the game to optimize the experience.

Wrongs:

    We didn't do a great job of predicting what would be achievable. We often
    fell short of our check-in goals due to some features taking much longer to
    implement than expected.

    We mostly communicated over slack as opposed to in person, which sometimes
    led to miscommunications due to the limitations of the medium. If we could
    do it again, we would try to meet in person more often.
