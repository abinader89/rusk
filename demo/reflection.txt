Most people seemed to enjoy our game a lot. We played a couple games of each
type (2 player, 3 player, and 4 player), so it was nice to see that everyone
seemed to like all of the game types. We received really positive feedback
on the art on the menu screen.

Although we have a writeup of the controls, some users need additional
explaining for how the turn phases progress. This was mostly a limitation due
to using the arrow keys, since mouse control was a stretch goal that we didn't
get to.

We found one bug where if users progressed to the next turn while still in
attack mode, it made the next user unable to attack. This manifested as some
tiles that should have been attackable showing as unattackable.
We have since fixed this bug.

We were surprised by how little people seemed to be offended by the UI. We
were worried that it was a bit too primitive, but people seemed interested
enough in the gameplay that it didn't matter.
