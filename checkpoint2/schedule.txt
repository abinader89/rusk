CHECKPOINT 1:

- Created a game model that encompasses the state of the game
STATUS: game model exists, doesn't encompass ENTIRE state yet
- Ability to instantiate game model based on input of owned hexes/number of dice
STATUS: ability exists, but currently only instantiate with defaults
- Ability to show grid based on game model
STATUS: we show a fake game screen for the moment
- Ability to let users end their turns without doing anything (optional)
STATUS: unstarted

SDL2 took a lot longer to set up than anticipated, so it turns out we were a bit ambitious with where we wanted to be. The
foundational game model is coming along very nicely though. We've added missed goals to checkpoint 2.

CHECKPOINT 2:

- Players are able to distribute dice at the beginning of their turn
STATUS: our gameModel supports this, but we haven't fully implemented controls for it.
- Players are able to attack at the end of their turn
STATUS: no turns yet
- Ability to show grid based on game model
STATUS: complete
- 50% code coverage
STATUS: we have 1 method covered.
- Ability to let users end their turns without doing anything (optional)
STATUS: unstarted
- Dice rolling animations when attacking, highlight available moves (optional)
STATUS: unstarted

getting CXXTEST setup was a bit of a nightmare (despite the unit testing homework going smoothly), so we didn't get to as much as we'd hoped.

FINAL:

- implement multiplayer with full functionality of turns (already exists in gameModel, just no controls)
- Game ends when one player no longer controls any hexes
- Ability to let users end their turns without doing anything
- Ability to let users attack
- Flesh out combat math
- Create last 2 maps
- Game properly identifies winner
- 50%+ code coverage
- Dice rolling animations when attacking, highlight available moves (optional)
