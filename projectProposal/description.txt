DESCRIPTION:

This game is a 2 player game. The scene will be a grid of hexagons.
Each hexagon will start with a number of dice (D6), and will either be assigned
to player 1, player 2, or 'neutral'. The goal of the game is to conquer the
other player's territories. The players will take turns. Each turn consists of
2 stages: the reinforcement stage and the attack stage.

In the reinforcement stage, the player is given n dice where n is the number of
territories that they control. They may distribute these dice as they see fit.
Each hexagon has a maximum of 20 dice.

In the attack stage, the player may attack any hexagons adjacent to hexagons
that they control. This attack moves all but one of the dice to the new hexagon.
A roll-off occurs. If the sum of the the values of the attacker's dice is
greater than the sum of the defender's dice, they occupy the square. Otherwise,
they lose all of the dice used in the attack. The player may continue attacking
until they choose to end their turn or are no longer able to attack.

The game is over when one player no longer controls any hexagons. The last
player standing wins.
